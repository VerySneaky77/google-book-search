# Google Books Search

### Overview

Search a local database with books from the google books database for books that interest you.

### About

Visitors should be able to fill in a title search field and then query the database for a list of books with the word in the title.

### Current Impementation

The React components and pages render and behave as expected. There is 1 element missing to be implemented on the DOM and that is an inclusion of an element to add selected books from a search into the local visitors book database.

### Failures

The file directories have become unwieldy, specifically the ones which organize the routes. Tracing and correcting errors has likely resulted in new ones cropping up. This would require a reorganization via a restart.
